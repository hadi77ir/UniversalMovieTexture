# Universal Movie Texture
This project is a part of "Universal Multimedia for Unity".

The next-generation MovieTexture package with support for a wide range of video formats and containers.

This project was created with the goal of providing FFMPEG goodies to Unity community. Some of these goodies are:
- Cross-platform use of MovieTextures (all supported target environments)
- Support for almost any video format (e.g. x265 HEVC, x264, Dirac, ...)
- Use FFMPEG inputs (webcam input, etc.)
- Hardware-accelerated decoding
- Compatibility with some available packages which make use of the reference Theora implementation
- And many more...

### What's Next? (Roadmap)
When this project gets to a stable state, I will begin working on "Universal Audio Clip" to bring the FFMPEG audio decoder to Unity.
After that, we will start merging these projects as modules for the "Universal Multimedia Project for Unity".
